# HEVC Cache Simulator

A cache simulator for the HEVC Test Model.

This tool converts trace files generated by the HM encoder into read/write operations. These operations are interpreted by the `cpu_cache_simulator` module, providing the hit count and miss count as output.

## Cache parameters

```
Associativity: 2-way (associativity = 1)
Cache size: 64KB (size = 16)
Write policy: WT
Replacement policy: LRU
```

## Results

The simulations were performed for the first 9 frames of each video sequence.
